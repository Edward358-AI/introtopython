# Variables

One of the most important parts of coding are variables. Variables are things that store      values. They can store anything, be it numbers or words. For example, if we did 
`foo = 1`
The variable in this case would be foo, and the value stored in foo is 1

## What is an Integer

An integer is a number that doesn't have decimal places, simple as that. For example, 5 and -5 are both integers because they do not have decimal places. However, 3.1 is not an integer bec ause it has a decimal place.

## What is a String

A string is a string of characters (which is why its called a string). This means that is can basically be anything. For example, 'hi' is a string, and so is '5'. The reason '5' is a string but 5 is an integer is because of the single quotes. A string is marked by these single quotes, so if you want to define a string, make sure to enclose it in single quotes.
