# Computers

Before we start talking about Python, it's a good idea to know a little bit about the computers we use. There's two main components: hardware and software.

## Hardware

Hardware is the physical "stuff" that makes up our computers: like the green silicon chips with complex circuitry. The main parts of our computer are the motherboard, the RAM (**R**andom **A**ccess **M**emory), the HDD (**H**ard **D**isk **D**rive) or SSD (**S**olid **S**tate **D**rive), the CPU, and the GPU.

The motherboard connects all of the components of the computer together.

Meanwhile, the RAM is like a temporary storage. It can store things that are necessary for the computer to function: Like what color is in this specific point of the screen? When your computer shuts down, things in the RAM are gone, because RAM needs to have a constant flow of electricity to remember things.

HDD and SDD store things in the long term. For example, they can store an image you write. When your computer turns off, the data on your drives isn't lost.

The CPU and the GPU process everything. They run optimized mathematical functions many times every second. The GPU in particular works on operations on images, resulting in what you get on your screen.

## Software

Software contains things like programs and applications on your computer. Your web browser is software. So are your video games. They tell the computer what to do.

In this course, we will be working on programming with Python; so we will be working with software and not hardware.
