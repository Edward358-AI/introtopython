# Variables

One of the most important parts of coding are variables. Variables are things that store values. At home, when you want to remember something, you write it down on a note. In this way, variables are just like notes, but for the computer to remember. They can store anything, from numbers to words. Here is an example of defining a variable.

```python
>>> x = 3
```

We stored the value 3 inside of the variable x.

## Integers

An integer is a number that doesn't have decimal places. For example, 5 and -5 are both integers because they do not have decimal places. However, 3.1 is not an integer because it has a decimal place.

```python
>>> x = 5
>>> y = 3
```

## Strings

A string is a sequence of characters. This means that is can basically be anything. For example, 'hi' is a string, and so is '5'. The reason '5' is a string but 5 is an integer is because of the quotes. A string is marked by these quotes, so if you want to define a string, make sure to enclose it in quotes. As you can see below, you can use either single quotes or double quotes but you can't mix them together.

```python
>>> my_favorite_fruit = 'apple'
>>> my_favorite_juice = "pineapple juice"
>>> my_favorite_salad = "caesar'
```
