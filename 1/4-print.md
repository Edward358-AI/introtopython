# Print Statements

If you want to see your code actually doing something, we are going to have to print stuff    out. If you look at the right hand side of repl, you will see a big black box. That is where  your program will be printing stuff.

## How to use Prints

In python, this is the print statement: `print( )`. It will print whatever is in between theparenthesis. What do you think these print statements will do?

`print(1)`
`print(14)`

We can go into repl and try it out!

What if I put a variable inside the print statement? What would happen if we did this:

`foo = 3`
`print(foo)`

Once again, we can head over to repl and try it out.

What happens if I want to print out a string? Lets try this to print out 'hi':

`print(hi)`

What happens when we run it in repl?

We get an error because since we didn't enclose hi inside single quotes, python is looking for a variable called hi. If we want to print out strings, we have to remember to put them inside single quotes.
