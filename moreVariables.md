## More On Variables

You'll recall that variables can store any sort of values. For example, `foo = 5`, foo is the variable, storing the value 5. 

We want to get a little bit more in depth now. There are many different types of values that  variables can store. We will focus on integers and strings for now.

# What is an Integer

An integer is a number that doesn't have decimal places, simple as that. For example, 5 and -5 are both integers because they do not have decimal places. However, 3.1 is not an integer because it has a decimal place. 

#What is a String

A string is a string of characters (which is why its called a string). This means that is can basically be anything. For example, 'hi' is a string, and so is '5'. The reason '5' is a string but 5 is an integer is because of the single quotes. A string is marked by these single quotes, so if you want to define a string, make sure to enclose it in single quotes.
