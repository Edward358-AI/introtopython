# Where do we code

Before we start coding, we need a place where we can write and run the code. This is where    IDEs come in handy, or **I**ntegrated **D**evelopment **E**vironments. IDEs allow us to easilywrite our python code and run it all in the same place. There are thousands of IDEs out there,but the ones we will be using is called repl.

## What is repl

Repl(repl.it) is an online IDE which has all the features of other IDEs that we will need. It is convenient for us to use because we won't need to install any outside applications as it   will work right from the website. Let's head over to repl and create our first project!
