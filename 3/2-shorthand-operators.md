# Shorthand operators

You might think it's inconvenient sometimes when you're modifying a variable. Here's how we normally would add 10 to a value:

```python
my_variable = 10
my_variable = my_variable+10
```

Luckily for us, Python has some shorter operators we can use.

```python
my_variable = 10
my_variable += 10
```

What this is doing is adding 10 to the value in `my_variable` and then updating `my_variable`. At the end of this snippet, `my_variable`'s value will be 20.

This also works with all of the other operators we have learned about.
